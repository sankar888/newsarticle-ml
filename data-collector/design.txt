Decided to use MongoDB for Storage of News Feed. And to write a service for scraping data feed and storing it to MOngoDB
The datacollector service needs configuration details, which can be fetched from mongoDB itself.
The configuration provider should be generic and can be switched with any implementation.
The Storage layer (mongoDB) for now should also be generic and be easily switched with any implementation
